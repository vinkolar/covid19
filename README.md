## Highlights
### Mar 20
* No drastic death rate increases in any of the top countries which have been reporting cases for some time
* Phillipines, Japan, Sweden are doing good job in "flattening" the exponential curve
* The rate of cases reported from Taiwan, Singapore and Thailand seems to have increased dramatically. This may be because testing has accelerated, which is good.

### Mar 19
* Number of cases reported in US still is growing expoentially. Num cases reported grew from around 7.7k (yesterday) to 13k (today). This may be because of active testing going on. Good news is that the US death rate is **not** growing; it is steady at 1.4-1.5%
* Italy overtakes China today in number of deaths ableit the huge disparity in respective population numbers
* France and US overtakes South Korea by a large margin -- in terms of number of cases reported
* France death rate grows from around 1.6% to 2.2%. 
* UK death rate climbs from around 2.7% to 5%
